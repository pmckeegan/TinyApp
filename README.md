# TinyApp
TinyApp URL shortener project for Lighthouse Labs.
TinyApp is a full stack web app built using Node and Express that allows users to shorten long urls into a short string of random characters (like bit.ly). It uses cookie session for session storage and bcrypt to encrypt passwords. It uses a random string generator to create the random shortened url's.
